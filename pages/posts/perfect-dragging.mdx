I recently started writing a post about [snapping](https://twitter.com/steveruizok/status/1449866480401764359) but realized I needed to write a post about dragging first.

So in this post, I'm going to quickly cover how to drag a shape on a canvas, or in an application that uses some kind of [zoom ui](/posts/zoom-ui). While it seems simple, this is a feature that I see many applications get wrong!

## Deltas

When a user drags a shape, its our job to calculcate the shape's new position based on whatever browser event we've receivedâ€”usually a mouse move, touch move, or pointer move.

In many applications, this new position is calculated by finding the pointer's movement, i.e. the difference between the pointer's _current_ point and its _previous_ point).

However, it's far better to calculate the shape's position by taking the pointer's _delta_, i.e. the difference between the pointer's _current_ point and its _original_ point, from when the drag began.

Then, rather than calculating the shape's new position by adding the delta to the shape's _current_ point, we would add the delta to the shape's _initial_ point instead.

There are several advantages to this approach:

- You can update the position while scrolling during the drag.
- You can restore shape's position if the user cancels the drag.
- You can freely adjust the delta with features like snapping, precision mode, or elastic bounds.

## Implementation

Here's an example implementation of what I mean.

First, some helpers for the vector math:

```ts
const add = (a: number[], b: number[]) => [a[0] + b[0], a[1] + b[1]]

const sub = (a: number[], b: number[]) => [a[0] - b[0], a[1] - b[1]]
```

And then our logic:

```ts
const shapes: Record<string, Shape> = {}

let dragging: {
  shape: Shape
  origin: number[]
}

function onDragStart(id: string, point: number[]) {
  dragging = {
    shape: { ...shapes[id] },
    origin: point,
  }
}

function onDrag(point: number[]) {
  if (dragging) {
    const delta = sub(point, dragging.origin)
    const nextPoint = add(dragging.shape.point, delta)
    shapes[dragging.shape.id].point = nextPoint
  }
}
```
