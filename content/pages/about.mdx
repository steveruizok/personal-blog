My name is Steve Ruiz and I'm a developer and interaction designer in London, currently working with creative tools. I build lots of prototypes. Sometimes those prototypes turn into products.

## My Work

I'm currently focusing on [tldraw](https://tldraw.com), a white-boarding application and an [engine](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw) for applications that render React components onto a canvas interface. You can [sponsor my work](https://github.com/sponsors/steveruizok) on Github!

I've previously worked with [Play](https://www.createwithplay.com/), helping to design a mobile-first design application for iOS. Before that, I was creating educational content for [Framer](https://framer.com/) and a user experience architect at [Inviqa](https://inviqa.com/). I've also worked with [ClearScore](https://www.clearscore.com/), [Phenomen Films](https://www.phenomentrust.org/), and plenty of shorter contracts, too.

## Open Source

I maintain a few open source projects:

- [tldraw](https://tldaw.com/) is a tiny little drawing app.
- [perfect-freehand](https://github.com/steveruizok/perfect-freehand) is a library for drawing freehand lines.
- [perfect-arrows](https://github.com/steveruizok/perfect-arrows) is a library for drawing arrows between points and shapes. It made for some fun [tweet threads](https://twitter.com/steveruizok/status/1283139008499986437).
- [state-designer](https://state-designer.com/) is a state management library with its own [visual design environment](https://ide.state-designer.com/). It's based on state charts and is great for prototyping.

## Education

I have my Masters degree in Fine Art from the University of Chicago. If you're curious, you can see more of my artwork [here](https://steveruizart.com).
