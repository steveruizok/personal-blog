title: "About"

My name is Steve Ruiz and I'm a developer, designer, and now startup founder in London. I have a background in visual art and work primarily in creative tools for the web. I build lots of prototypes. Sometimes those prototypes turn into products.

## tldraw

I'm currently running [tldraw](https://x.com/tldraw), a startup I formed in 2022 around my [infinite canvas SDK for React](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw) of the same name. Developers use the tldraw SDK to accelerate development of whiteboards and other canvas-like applications. The project's "demo" ([tldraw.com](tldraw.com)) has become a popular end-user application, too, with close to 500,000 monthly active users. We're a Series A company based by [Lux](https://www.luxcapital.com/), [Definition](https://www.definitioncap.com/), [Amplify](https://www.amplifypartners.com/), and others; and we're based in London with our office in Finsbury Park.

## Previous Work

I've previously worked with [Play](https://www.createwithplay.com/), helping to design a mobile-first design application for iOS. Before that, I was creating educational content for [Framer](https://framer.com/).

## Open Source

I've created and occassionally maintain several source projects:

- [tldraw](https://tldraw.com/) is a tiny little drawing app.
- [globs](https://globs.design/) is a globs-based design app.
- [perfect-freehand](https://github.com/steveruizok/perfect-freehand) is a library for drawing freehand lines.
- [perfect-arrows](https://github.com/steveruizok/perfect-arrows) is a library for drawing arrows between points and shapes. It made for some fun [tweet threads](https://twitter.com/steveruizok/status/1283139008499986437).
- [state-designer](https://state-designer.com/) is a state management library with its own [visual design environment](https://ide.state-designer.com/). It's based on state charts and is great for prototyping.
