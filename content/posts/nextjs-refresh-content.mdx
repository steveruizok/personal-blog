Are you writing MDX content for a Next.js blog and want to see live reloads when the content changes? Here's how to do it.

## The Solution

Install some dependencies:

```bash
npm i -D ws concurrently tsx
```

Create a `watcher.ts` file in the root of your Next.js project.

```ts
import fs from 'fs'
import { WebSocketServer } from 'ws'

const CONTENT_FOLDER = 'content'

fs.watch(
	CONTENT_FOLDER,
	{ persistent: true, recursive: true },
	async (eventType, fileName) => {
		clients.forEach((ws) => {
			// do any pre-processing you want to do here...
			ws.send('refresh')
		})
	}
)

const wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 3201 })

const clients = new Set<any>()

wss.on('connection', function connection(ws) {
	clients.add(ws)
	ws.on('error', console.error)
	ws.on('close', () => clients.delete(ws))
})
```

Create a script in your `package.json` that starts the watcher on `dev`.

```json
{
  ...,
  "scripts": {
		"dev": "concurrently \"next dev\" \"tsx ./watcher.ts\" --kill-others",
  }
}
```

Create a component named `AutoRefresh`.

```tsx
'use client'

import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'
import { useEffect } from 'react'

let AutoRefresh = ({ children }: { children: any }) => children

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
	AutoRefresh = ({ children }) => {
		const router = useRouter()

		useEffect(() => {
			const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:3201')
			ws.onmessage = (event) => {
				if (event.data === 'refresh') {
					router.refresh()
				}
			}
			return () => {
				ws.close()
			}
		}, [router])
		return children
	}
}

export default AutoRefresh
```

Wrap your root `layout.tsx` in the `AutoRefresh` component.

```tsx
async function RootLayout({ children }: { children: any }) {
	return (
		<AutoRefresh>
			<html>...</html>
		</AutoRefresh>
	)
}

export default RootLayout
```

## The problem

Vercel provides excellent documentation of using Markdown / MDX together with Next.js (including with its new App Router). While it's possible to have `.mdx` files [map 1-1 to pages](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/mdx) using the file-based routing system, this is impractical for most projects and especially for projects with many dozens or hundreds of content files. For these projects, the answer has been to use [remote MDX](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/mdx#remote-mdx) via the Hashicorp library [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote#react-server-components-rsc--nextjs-app-directory-support), where content files are created server-side upon first request.

This is a great solution, but it has one drawback: the Next.js App Router does not refresh when content in the folder changes. This is a problem for content creators who want to see their changes reflected in the browser without having to restart the server or manually refresh the page.

The solution _used_ to be using a library named `next-remote-watch`. However, this library only seems to work with the pages directory and does not work with the new Next.js app router.

Luckily, [Dan Abramov](https://github.com/gaearon/overreacted.io/pull/797/files) found a great solution. Here's the version of that solution that I used on the [tldraw docs site](https://tldraw.dev).

## How it works

When you run `npm run dev`, you'll start a regular Next.js dev server _and_ a websocket server. That server will use `fs.watch` to observe changes in a folder where your content is stored. Meanwhile, when the root layout mounts, a hook in the `AutoRefresh` component will connect to the websocket server. Once it's connected, it will set a listener will call `router.refresh()` when it receives a `refresh` message from the websocket server.

When the server detects a change anywhere in the content directory, the websocket server will send a `refresh` message to its connected clients, which will trigger the listener in in the `AutoRefresh` component and cause the Next.js App Router to refresh.

## Tweaks and modifications

You can do whatever you want inside of `watcher.ts` before dispatching the `refresh` event.

In our case, we respond to a change in the content directory by parsing every file in the content directory, stuffing it into a sqlite database, fixing navigation links, and so onâ€”and only when that's done (maybe 12ms later) do we send off the `refresh` event. However, because this is an asyncronous process, and because dev-mode react runs every hook, I've wrapped our watch callback in a debounce function to avoid trying to do the work twice in a row.

You can also dispatch the `refresh` event whenever you want, on an interval or in response to some other listener if you're pulling data from a different source. The general idea is still using websockets to trigger a refresh of the Next.js App Router.

And of course you don't have to use these exact libraries or methods. For example, you can skip `tsx` as a dependency and use a plain JavaScript for your watcher script. So long as you've got a websocket server running and a listener in your root layout, you're good to go.
