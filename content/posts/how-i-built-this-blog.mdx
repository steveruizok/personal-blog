import LightDarkSwitch from "../../components/theme-switch"

As a designer, I've spent my career borrowing development tools to build prototypes that needed a level of interactivity or data that couldn't be done in design tools alone. I was always more of a chainsaw artist than arborist, however, and so I skipped many of the projects that other developers start off with.

Recently, as the tools have become easier and more interesting, I've started drifting moving from making models to building actual projects meant to be used in production. And I've wanted a place to write about what I'm learning...

So welcome to my first blog.[^1]

## Stacking Technologies

Making a website like this blog means solving several different problems, such as how content should be turned into code, how elements of the site should be styled and themed, and how the website should get uploaded onto the internet.

While all of the solutions need to work together, a developer can use different technologies to solve each problem. They could write their own solution for each one, but would usually choose from the thousands of free and open-source solutions shared by other experts developers.

The result is a "stack" of technologies that is tuned to the specific needs of the website. The stack also expresses the constraints of the project, like budget and time, as well more subjective things, like the developer's interests and their preferred ways of working.

Here's my stack.

I designed this blog in Figma. I've built the website using the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework and I've deployed it to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/dashboard). I've written my [React](https://reactjs.org/) components in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and I've used [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/) for styling. I write my content in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).

If you're after the source code, you can find that [here](https://github.com/steveruizok/personal-blog).

In the sections below, I'll describe how I built this blog. I'll first introduce the "stack" of technologies that I used, then I'll break down each part of this stack and explain how it works with other parts of the stack. Along the way, I'll give some insight into my reasoning behind the choices I've made.

## Rendering Websites in React and Next.js

Let's start with the choice to use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as a framework. To learn about Next, we also need to learn a bit about React.

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a library for building user interfaces, created and maintained by Facebook. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a framework that builds on top of React in order to give developers more options in how they build and deploy websites.

In a Next project, your website's pages are defined as individual files, each containing the code for a React component that defines what is on that page. Like all React components, this page component can be made up of HTML tags, like `<p>` to describe paragraphs, as well as other reusable components, like `<Header>`s, `<Button>`s and `<Menu>`s, that you've defined elsewhere in your project.

```tsx
// pages/my-page.jsx

import Heading from "../components/heading"

function MyPage() {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <Title>My Blog</Title>
      <Heading>My First Post</Heading>
      <main>
        <p>Welcome to my blog!</p>
      </main>
    </Layout>
  )
}
```

While React code is easy to read and write, browsers like Chrome and Safari can't actually read it. They only speak two languages—HTML for markup and CSS for styling—and so a component like the one above will eventually need to be "rendered", or turned into the HTML and CSS that the browser can actually read.

```html
<!-- my-page.html -->

<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Blog</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <main>
      <h1 className="post-header">My First Post</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my blog!</p>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```

In a "normal" React project, this "rendering" process happens on a user's machine. When a user visits a React website, their browser downloads the React code for the website along with instructions on how to turn it into HTML and CSS. The user's browser runs that code, builds the page that the user wants to see, and shows the result to the user.

While this can result in bigger downloads and slower websites, this approach allows for highly "dynamic" pages that can easily render different content for different users. For example, a personalized news feed or a music app.

By contrast, a Next project is designed to create "server rendered" pages. Each Next project includes a "build" step where pages are "pre-rendered" into their final HTML and CSS upfront. When a user visits a page created by a Next project, their browser will only download these pre-rendered files, saving the user from having to download the whole site in order to build and render it themselves.

Server-side rendering can result in much smaller downloads and faster websites for projects with little or no dynamic content[^2]. And so, because this blog has no dynamic content, that choice was easy to make.

## Writing Content in MDX

React is great for creating the components of a website (things like the light mode / dark mode toggle at the top of this page) that come together to form a user interface. However, like HTML itself, React isn't a great language for long form written content, such as the content of this blog post.

Writing a post in React would look something like this:

```tsx
function MyFirstPost() {
  return (
    <PostLayout
      title="My First Blog Post"
      date="9/1/2020"
      hero="/images/my-hero-image.jpg"
    >
      <p>Welcome to my blog!</p>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        My name is <a href="https://twitter.com/steveruizok">Steve</a> and I'm a
        product designer who writes about design, code, and everything in
        between. I live in London but I'm originally from Chicago. It's been a{" "}
        <i>long</i> year, hasn't it?
      </p>
      <p>Anyway, thanks for reading!</p>
    </PostLayout>
  )
}
```

It's not impossible, but I think it's a clunky syntax for blogging. Other people have thought so too. In 2004, [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) created Markdown, a much more gentle syntax that a computer could easily convert into HTML. The same content, written in Markdown, would look like this:

```md
---
title: "My First Blog Post"
date: "9/1/2020"
hero: "/images/my-hero-image.jpg"
---

Welcome to my blog!

## Introduction

My name is [Steve](https://twitter.com/steveruizok) and I'm a product
designer who writes about design, code, and everything in between. I
live in London but I'm originally from Chicago. It's been a _long_
year, hasn't it?

Anyway, I thanks for reading!
```

That's much easier to read, write, and edit. It also contains a section at the top, between the two `---` lines, called the file's "frontmatter". I'll come back to this later, but this frontmatter text allows me to define custom properties for the post, such as its title, date, and hero image, that I can use elsewhere in my layout.

### Markdown to MDX

While Markdown is great for regular written content, it's limited to _just_ written content. What if I want to include a React component like this one, right here inside of my blog post?

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    justifyContent: "center",
    animation: "1s ease-in-out 1s infinite alternate bounce",
  }}
>
  <LightDarkSwitch />
</div>

Again, I'm not the first person to feel this way.

In 2018, after a few years of early experiments, [Guillermo Rauch](@rauchg) [proposed](https://spectrum.chat/frontend/general/mdx-proposal~1021be59-2738-4511-aceb-c66921050b9a) a new syntax called MDX.[^3] In the same way that Markdown converts text to HTML, MDX would convert text to React components, thereby giving authors much more control over how their content is rendered as well as allowing for inline React components.

```md
# Example

Here's a React component inside of my Markdown.

<LightDarkSwitch />

Pretty cool, right?
```

MDX has grown into an excellent tool for web authors, and so I've chosen to use it for this blog. Using MDX also allows me to use markdown for my `index`, `archive`, and `about` pages.

## Styling

When it comes to styling, React is an extremely flexible framework.

The most basic way to style content is by defining styles in a [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) file and then attaching their class names to the HTML elements in your React components.

```css
/* styles.css */

.post-link {
  padding: 24px;
  margin: -24px;
}

.post-link:hover {
  background-color: #eaf4fd;
}
```

```jsx
// post-link.tsx

function PostLink({ title, author }) {
  return (
    <a className="post-link">
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <p>{author}</p>
    </a>
  )
}
```

While this approach does work, it makes certain things more difficult. For example, the syntax for sharing variables for fonts, sizes, and other foundations can be clunky and verbose. Changing themes, such as between light and dark mode, can also require broad changes to variables and stylesheets. As a website grows, it's easy to get lost in your styles.

Such complexity, clunkiness and verbosity can all make development slower, more prone to error, and produce a worse experience for both developers and users.

### CSS in JS

For this reason, many developers reach for styling libraries that allow styles to be defined alongside their React components in JavaScript. The libraries take care of creating the CSS stylesheets and applying class names where needed.

There are several different styling libraries, but they all look something like this:

```jsx
// post-link.tsx

const HoverLink = styled("a", {
  padding: 24,
  margin: -24,
  "&:hover": {
    backgroundColor: "#eaf4fd",
  },
})

function PostLink({ title, author }) {
  return (
    <HoverLink>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <p>{author}</p>
    </HoverLink>
  )
}
```

More recently, other tools have built on top of these libraries in order to allow developers to define "themes" that can be easily swapped in and out.

In 2019, [Brent Jackson](https://twitter.com/jxnblk) defined a [theme specification](https://system-ui.com/theme/), or a pattern for defining such themes that other tools could follow. He later put this spec into practice with [theme-ui](https://theme-ui.com/theme-spec).

### From Theme-UI to Stitches

When I began this blog, I used theme-ui to define a theme and then built my components using [emotion](https://emotion.sh/), the styling library that powers theme-ui.

Later on, I switched to [Stiches](http://stitches.dev), a newly released library by the team at [Modulz](https://www.modulz.app/).[^4] Like theme-ui, it follows Jackson's theme specification; however, it has its own styling engine that may work better with the project's "static" approach.

My site has a core configuration that defines tokens for colors, sizes, spaces and breakpoints, and two themes that overwrite the configuration's colors tokens. Both the configuration and the themes are pretty basic.

```js
const { styled, css } = createStyled({
  tokens: {
    // ...
    fontSizes: {
      $0: "14px",
      $1: "16px",
      $2: "18px",
      $3: "20px",
      $4: "24px",
      $5: "28px",
    },
    fonts: {
      $body: "'Fira Sans', system-ui, sans-serif",
      $ui: "'Fira Sans', system-ui, sans-serif",
      $heading: '"Fira Sans", system-ui, sans-serif',
      $display: '"Fira Sans", system-ui, sans-serif',
      $monospace: '"Fira Code", Menlo, monospace',
    },
  },
  // ...
})
```

My components are more complex. They include theme from the theme along with different properties defined for each breakpoint.

```ts
const Container = styled(Grid, {
  gridTemplateColumns: "1fr repeat(4, auto)",
  gridGap: 0,
  alignItems: "center",
  justifyContent: "space-between",
  fontFamily: "$ui",
  mr: "-$0",
  mt: 0,
  mb: "$5",
  sm: {
    mt: "$2",
    mr: "-$1",
  },
})
```

I use these styled components throughout the site, such as for the site's header and footer. I also feed these components to MDX so that it will convert my MDX content into these styled components. As a result, whenever I decide to tweak values for spacing and colors in my configuration, those changes will apply throughout the blog's pages, layout, and content.

[^1]: Sort of. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, I wrote about art in Chicago under the official-sounding name [Chicago Art Review](http://chicagoartreview.com/). The site began as a Wordpress theme. Over the years I modified the theme and tried writing my own but never with much success. The closest I'd really come to "building a blog" was when I built [The Visualist](http://www.thevisualist.org/), a visual arts calendar for the Chicago art community, with a design by [Chad Kouri](https://chadkouri.com/about/). That was also a Wordpress project, but the theme was more custom and pretty complex. I'm still not sure how I got it to work, but it's still running.
[^2]: There is of course a tradeoff here: while static sites are perfect for blogs and other projects where each user will view the same content, they are harder to use for sites that need dynamic content. It can still be done, however, on a component-by-component basis; so unless _all_ of a site's content needs to be dynamic, this kind of partial SSR is probably a better choice!
[^3]: Rauch is also responsible for this blog's framework, Next.js, as well as its deployment platform, Vercel, so it owes much to him and his collaborators.
[^4]: What's the point of a blog if not to try out the latest tools?
