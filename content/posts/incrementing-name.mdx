Here's a fun problem that I ran into while working on [tldraw](https://tldraw.com)'s page menu: how do I increment a name to avoid duplication?

## The Problem

In tldraw, when you create a new page, and if there's already a page with that name, then we want the second page's name to end with an incremented value, e.g. `"Blog Post (1)"`.

```ts
const existing = ["Blog Post"]

function getName("Blog Post", existing) {
  return "Blog Post (1)"  // 0 -> 1
}
```

And if you create a new page _again_ without changing that first page's name? Then we'd want the third page's name to be `"Blog Post (2)"`.

```ts
const existing = ["Blog Post", "Blog Post (1)"]

function getName("Blog Post", existing) {
  return "Blog Post (2)" // 1 -> 2
}
```

We only want to match against the part of the name that exludes the incremented value. So adding `"Blog Post!"` should not get incremented, even if `"Blog Post"` exists already:

```ts
const existing = ["Blog Post"]

function getName("Blog Post!", existing) {
  return "Blog Post!" // no change
}
```

...and "Blog Post (1)!" should not prevent us from making a `"Blog Post (1)"`.

```ts
const existing = ["Blog Post", "Blog Post (1)!"]

function getName("Blog Post", existing) {
  return "Blog Post (1)" // Ignores Blog Post (1)!
}
```

How to do it?

## The Answer

Here's the solution:

```ts
// Will return "(1)" from "Blog Post (1)"
const INCREMENT = new RegExp(/\s\((\d+)\)$/);

// Will return "1" from "(1)"
const INCREMENT_INT = new RegExp(/\d+(?=\)$)/);

/**
 * Get an incremented name (e.g. New page (2)) from a name (e.g. New page), based on an array of
 * existing names.
 *
 * @param name The name to increment.
 * @param others The array of existing names.
 */
export function getName(name: string, others: string[]) {
  const set = new Set(others);

  let result = name;

  while (set.has(result)) {
    result = INCREMENT.exec(result)?.[1]
      ? result.replace(INCREMENT_INT, (m) => (+m + 1).toString())
      : `${result} (1)`;
  }

  return result;
}
```

How does it work?

We call the `getName` function with the input name (`name`) and an array of exising names (`others`) that may or may not contain matches. We first turn that array into a Set, so that we can check for a value without iteration.

In a while loop, we check if the `others` includes the current `result`.

If the `others` set has the current `result`, then we mutate the `result`: either by adding a `" (1)"` if the result isn't already incremented, or else, if the result is already incremented, by incrementing the number between the parentheses.

Then our `while` loop checks again. This allows for higher increments: we may have we've just turned `"Blog Post"` into `"Blog Post (1)"`, but the array might include _that_ name, too; and so we need to keep going until we can't find a match.

Once we have a unique name, we can return the result.
