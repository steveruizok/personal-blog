Ever need to filter properties from an object? Here's how to do it.

In JavaScript:

```js
function filterObject(obj, fn) {
  return Object.fromEntries(Object.entries(obj).filter(fn))
}
```

It's a bit trickier in TypeScript:

```ts
type Entry<T> = {
  [K in keyof T]: [K, T[K]]
}[keyof T]

function filterObject<T extends object>(
  obj: T,
  fn: (entry: Entry<T>, i: number, arr: Entry<T>[]) => boolean
) {
  return Object.fromEntries(
    (Object.entries(obj) as Entry<T>[]).filter(fn)
  ) as Partial<T>
}
```

In either case, we can use our `filterObject` helper to return a new copy of an object with certain keys removed. Our filter function works just like `Array.filter`, except that its callback function's first parameter will be the property's key value pair as array (`[key, value]`).

```ts
const author = { name: "Steve", age: 93, height: 241 }

const onlySteves = filterObject(author, ([k, v]) => v === "Steve")
// { name: "Steve" }

const onlyNumbers = filterObject(author, ([k, v]) => typeof v === "number")
// { age: 93, height: 241 }

const onlyNames = filterObject(author, ([k, v]) => k === "name")
// { name: "Steve" }
```

### Older Browsers

If you wanted to do this by hand (or perhaps in older browsers without polyfills for `Object.fromEntries` and `Object.entries`), you could also do it this way: create a shallow copy of the object, iterate once to generating the entries, and then iterate again to `delete` filtered properties.

```ts
function filterObject2<T extends object>(
  obj: T,
  fn: (entry: Entry<T>, i: number, arr: Entry<T>[]) => boolean
): Partial<T> {
  const next = { ...obj }

  const entries: Entry<T>[] = []

  for (const key in obj) {
    entries.push([key, obj[key]])
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < entries.length; i++) {
    const entry = entries[i]
    if (!fn(entry, i, entries)) {
      delete next[entry[0]]
    }
  }

  return next
}
```

Enjoy!
