As a designer, I rely on design tools every day in order to do my work. As a designer working on _making_ design tools, I tend to look closely and critically at the tools I use. And it's tempting to ignore the thousands of things that these tools do right and instead become obsessed with the petty or meaningless faults I discover.

This is that kind of article.

Take another look at this article's hero image, a screenshot from Figma showing its default star shape. Notice anything off? Well, if it looks fine to you now, I promise you that by the end of this article you will have joined me in my sufferingâ€”or at least feel an educated pity towards my plight.

**Because that star is off-center**.

It's stuck to the top of its bounding box.

And it's not just Figma. It doesn't matter what tool you use. **They're _all_ wrong.**

## The Rogue's Gallery

Here's the default star in Sketch:

Here's the default star in Framer:

Here again is the default star in Figma:

Here's the default star in Proto.io:

And finally, while Adobe XD doesn't have a star shape, it does have a Polygon shape that can be used to create stars.

Alright, so not _every_ design tool has this bug.

For the rest, though, what's the problem?

To find out, we'll need to learn about how these tools draw their stars.

## How to Draw a Star

![Animated star-drawing algorithm.](/images/star-alg.gif)

To draw a star with _n_ points inside of a bounding box:

1. Draw a circle that touches all four corners of the bounding box.
2. Starting from the top and center, place _n_ points equally-spaced around the circle's circumference.
3. Draw a second circle inside of the first.
4. Starting from the bottom and center, place _n_ points equally-spaced around this circle's circumference.
5. Draw lines that connect the points.
