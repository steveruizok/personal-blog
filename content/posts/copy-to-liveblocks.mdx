---

I recently implemented a feature in [tldraw](https://tldraw.com "tldraw") that lets a user copy the contents of their current page into a new multiplayer project. There are still some issues around images and videos (as these need to be converted and uploaded separately) but it should be a pretty handy feature if you want to share a project or collaborate on something. Just send the link!

In this post, I'll walk through how it works.

## Liveblocks Storage

tldraw's multiplayer implementation is powered by [Liveblocks](https://liveblocks.io/ "Liveblocks"), a product that offers real time collaboration as a service. We use their presence API for cursor locations and selection, as well as their storage API for synchronizing the document. While there's plenty of client-side conflict resolution to make it all work, it's been a great "drop-in" solution for avoiding conflicts in a project's source of truth.

A few weeks ago, Liveblocks updated their [REST API](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints) to include endpoints for reading and writing directly to a room's storage, which is what let me write the new feature.

## Our own API Endpoint

To make this feature work, I first needed to create an API endpoint on tldraw.com that could act as an intermediary between the tldraw client application and the Liveblocks API. The tldraw app would send data to the tldraw.com API endpoint, where the site's server would authenticate with Liveblocks and then send the data to Liveblocks. If all went well, my endpoint would then send back the new multiplayer project's URL and the app would navigate to that URL.

> ðŸš€ Remember, tldraw is open source! You can find the finished endpoint [here](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/blob/main/apps/www/pages/api/create.ts).

Being a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project, creating the endpoint was no problem. I made a new file at `/pages/api/create.ts` that expected to receive data from the application in the request body. In my case, the body is going to contain the user's tldraw `document` and their current `pageId`.

```ts
// pages/api/create.ts

import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next"

type storageJson = {
  pageId: string
  document: TDDocument
}

export default async function CreateMultiplayerRoom(
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse
) {
  try {
    // 1. Get an authentication token from Liveblocks
    // 2. Create the Liveblocks storage JSON
    // 3. Post the JSON and token to Liveblocks
  } catch (e) {
    res.send({ status: "error", message: e.message })
  }
}
```

The endpoint would need to do three things:

1. Get an authentication token from Liveblocks
2. Create the Liveblocks storage JSON
3. Post the JSON and token to Liveblocks

### Getting the Authentication Token

Authenticating with Liveblocks requires a private key. Because I have been using Liveblocks for the site's multiplayer service, I already had my keys in an `.env` file. And, because tldraw is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), I had these in my project's [environment variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables) as well.

Here's what they look like in my `.env` file:

```ts
// .env

NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEBLOCKS_PUBLIC_API_KEY = pk_live_whatever
LIVEBLOCKS_SECRET_KEY = sk_live_whatever
```

Ok, back to my `pages/api/creates.ts` endpoint. With my keys in the environment, I next needed to get my authentication token from Liveblocks via their [authorize endpoint](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#Authentication).

```ts
const { token } = await fetch("https://liveblocks.io/api/authorize", {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.LIVEBLOCKS_SECRET_KEY}`,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
}).then((d) => d.json())
```

The authorize endpoint responds with the web token I'd need to communicate with Liveblocks' storage API.

### Creating the Storage JSON

Before I could `POST` my data to the Liveblocks storage API endpoint, however, I first needed to turn my tldraw document object into the JSON format that Liveblocks expects to receive.

```ts
const { pageId, document } = JSON.parse(req.body) as RequestBody

const storageJson = {
  liveblocksType: "LiveObject",
  data: {
    version: 2.1,
    shapes: {
      liveblocksType: "LiveMap",
      data: {},
    },
    bindings: {
      liveblocksType: "LiveMap",
      data: {},
    },
    assets: {
      liveblocksType: "LiveMap",
      data: {},
    },
  },
}

const page = document.pages[pageId]

storageJson.data.shapes.data = page.shapes ?? {}
storageJson.data.bindings.data = page.bindings ?? {}
storageJson.data.assets.data = document.assets ?? {}
```

Luckily our models are fairly similar (tables of objects keyed under their `id`) so this wasn't much work.

### Sending the Storage JSON to Liveblocks

Finally, with my authentication token and my storage JSON ready, I could create a unique ID for the `roomId`, stringify my `storageJson`, and post it to the Liveblocks API endpoint.

```ts
const roomId = Utils.uniqueId()

const result = await fetch(
  `https://liveblocks.net/api/v1/room/${roomId}/storage`,
  {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify(storageJson),
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${auth.token}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
  }
)
```

If all went well, my API endpoint would reply to the original tldraw client application's request with a response that contained the new project's URL, based on the `roomId`.

```ts
if (result.status === 200) {
  // If success, send back the url for the new multiplayer project
  res.send({
    status: "success",
    message: result.statusText,
    url: "/r/" + roomId,
  })
} else {
  throw Error(result.statusText)
}
```

The client would then navigate to the URLâ€”and the user would see their same page content ready for them in the multiplayer editor.

## Other APIs

As a final note, there are a few other Liveblocks APIs related to storage that I may use in the future. In addition to creating storage for a room via a `POST`, I could also `GET` the storage for room or `DELETE` its data instead. Eventually, I may use the other two in order to avoid situations where a user tries to copy to a `roomId` that already exists.

For completeness sake, here's the code I'd use for `GET` and `DELETE`:

```ts
fetch(`https://liveblocks.net/api/v1/room/${roomId}/storage`, {
  method: "GET",
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${auth.token}`,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
})
```

```ts
fetch(`https://liveblocks.net/api/v1/room/${roomId}/storage`, {
  method: "DELETE",
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${auth.token}`,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
})
```

Thanks for reading!
